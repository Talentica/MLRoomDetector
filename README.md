In past few years, the use of machine learning to solving complex problems have been increasing. In WWDC 2017 Apple provided machine learning videos which uses CoreML framework and later they released Turi Create as an easy to use tool for custom machine learning models. Turi Create focus on tasks instead of Algotithms and using Turi Create we can tackle a number of scenerios:

    •    Recommender systems
    •    Image classification
    •    Image similarity
    •    Object detection
    •    Activity classifier
    •    Text classifier
    
The objective of this project is to detect a room by an unique object inside the room using Turi Create and then show the room details using ARKit. Luckily the room in which I conducted this task goes by the name ‘Donald Knuth’. So I will be showing a little background of the computer scientist using ARKit scene view.
